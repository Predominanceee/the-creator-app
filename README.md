# 🌿 The Creator App

**The Creator** is a minimalist emotional wellness app designed for quiet reflection.  
It offers users a space to process emotions like sadness, joy, fear, or calm — through writing, breathing, or simply being.

This is not productivity.  
This is not self-optimization.  
This is space. For you.

## 🪞 Vision

Too many wellness apps feel cold, clinical, or overwhelming.  
**The Creator** was born from burnout — a desire to feel human again.

It invites users into emotionally guided *Rooms*, where they can:
- Write without judgment
- Breathe without pressure
- Speak without performance

Everything here is designed to feel safe.  
Simple. Quiet. Honest.
